### üéÆFitPlay - Human Activity Recognition Using Machine Learning and mpu_6050 Sensors

> FitPlay is an interactive exergame that uses real-time human activity recognition (HAR) to create an immersive fitness gaming experience. The game encourages physical exercise by mimicking activities such as jogging, squatting, jumping, and standing, using data from wearable motion sensors i.e. mpu_6050.

## Game Preview
**FitPlay** combines motion sensing and machine learning to create an engaging fitness game. By performing real-world actions like jumping, squatting, or jogging, players control an in-game avatar‚Äîpromoting health while having fun.

## System Architecture

**How it works?**

The sensors capture 6-axis motion data (accelerometer + gyroscope).

Data is classified in real-time using an SVM model.

The game responds to classified actions‚Äîjump, squat, run‚Äîtriggering the in-game avatar.

## Setup Instructions

# Requirements
Unity (2021 or later)

Python 3.8+

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro with USB HID support)

MPU6050 Sensors √ó3

USB cable to connect microcontroller to PC

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pyserial

# Steps

1.Connect sensors to microcontroller.

2.Upload firmware to microcontroller.

3.Collect and label data using Python scripts i.e. data_collection.py And prepare Datasets for the model.

4.Train SVM model.

5.Launch Unity and link it to your Python classifier(modify the data_collection.py inserting your trained model for real time classification).

6.Start the game and move to play!
